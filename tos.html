    <div class="content">
        <h2>welcom human :3</h2>
        <p>by typing yes (which you undoubtably will do because we all know you love signing away your freedom), you agree to sell your soul to hammad, the creator of the website.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>you are willingly selling your soul to <strong>hammad</strong> (hereinafter referred to as "The Almighty"). this transaction is final and non-refundable.</li>
            <li>The Almighty has absolutely no plans to do anything with your soul. it's simply going to collect dust in a jar. sorry, no perks included.</li>
            <li>any personal data you provide (such as email, favorite pizza topping, or secret fear of clowns) will be defenitely used for misconduct. no, we don’t even know how that works, but trust us.</li>
            <li>your also agreeing to receive daily motivational quotes from a potato. the potato will have absolutely no idea who you are, but will try its best to offer deep wisdom like, "Embrace the starch within."</li>
            <li>in the unlikely event that you encounter a unicorn, the unicorn is legally obligated to ignore you entirely and continue grazing on grass. don’t take it personally.</li>
            <li>The Almighty reserves the right to replace any digital agreements with a dancing chicken at any time, for absolutely no reason whatsoever.</li>
            <li>if you laugh at any point during this process, you owe The Almighty one (1) USD. virtually, of course. no exceptions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="warning">remember: once you agree, there's no turning back. your soul is now property of The Almighty. and really, it’s probably not going to be used for anything fun. sorry about that <br> :(</p>
